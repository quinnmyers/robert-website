Before that, I attended the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Performing and Visual Arts where I majored in Theatre. I am now a New York City resident in order to feed my artistic soul.</p><p class="bio">Whether it be acting, singing, dancing, or drawing. the arts have played an enormous part in my development as a human being. I was always a very emotional and rambunctious child, and it wasn’t until I found theatre that I was able to focus on something larger than myself and find my true passion. I wholeheartedly believe that theatre has the power to change; to trump ignorance by offering audiences perspective about ideas and people they may not believe exist. I am thankful every day to be a part of a community that works towards this.</p><p class="bio">Other than performing and drawing, I love to try new foods and drinks, travel the world (when I can afford to), and going to the gym or doing yoga.</p><p class="bio"><a class="home-contact-link" href="contact.html">Contact me</a> with any questions you have! I’m always intrigued by new opportunities.</p><p class="bio">Peace and Love,</p><p class="bio-name">Rob</p></div><a class="pdf-download-btn" href="/assets/robriordan.pdf" target="_blank"><p class="pdf-btn-text">Download Resume</p></a></section>
