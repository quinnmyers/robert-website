<section class="bio"><div class="bio-container"><h1 class="page-title">BIO</h1></div><div class="bio-image"></div><div class="bio-text"><p class="bio">I am a proud BFA graduate in Musical Theatre from The Conservatory of Theatre Arts at Webster University (2016). Before that, I attended the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Performing and Visual Arts where I majored in Theatre. I am now a New York City resident in order to feed my artistic soul.</p><p class="bio">Whether it be acting, singing, dancing, or drawing. the arts have played an enormous part in my development as a human being. I was always a very emotional and rambunctious child, and it wasn’t until I found theatre that I was able to focus on something larger than myself and find my true passion. I wholeheartedly believe that theatre has the power to change; to trump ignorance by offering audiences perspective about ideas and people they may not believe exist. I am thankful every day to be a part of a community that works towards this.</p><p class="bio">Other than performing and drawing, I love to try new foods and drinks, travel the world (when I can afford to), and going to the gym or doing yoga.</p><p class="bio">Contact me with any questions you have! I’m always intrigued by new opportunities.</p><p class="bio">Peace and Love,</p><p class="bio">Rob</p></div></section>
